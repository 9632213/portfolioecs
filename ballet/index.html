            <h1>My expirience</h1>
<p>I took my very first ballet class at the age of 3. My mom put me in a ballet class for 1 hour a week just for fun. I loved it so much.
Those ballet classes for little kids were the best hour of my week. Ballet was my first love. And I have been doing it ever since. 
I have taken ballet at multiple studios, and have won ballet dancer of the year a few years ago. A year and a half ago I was approved to get my first pair of pointe shoes. 
I love doing pointe work and it is something I hope to continue to work on and do throughout high school!</p>
